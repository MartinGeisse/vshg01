How to program an MCS file into the parallel NOR flash ROM
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Connect a USB cable to the starter board. This is needed in order
   to program the FPGA to act as a flash programmer.

2. Connect a serial cable to the starter board. This is needed in
   order to communicate with the flash programmer and to transfer
   the MCS file.

3. Transfer the MCS file you wish to program into the flash ROM to
   the computer to which the serial cable is connected.

4. Start a serial communication program (e.g. minicom) on the computer
   at the other end of the serial cable. The communication parameters
   must be set as follows:
       - choose the serial port to which the cable is connected
         (this is /dev/ttyS0 on my computer)
       - 115200 baud
       - 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit ("8N1")
       - software flow control ("XON/XOFF protocol")
       - line wrap on (otherwise you won't see all chars of long lines)
       - add linefeed on (the programmer sends CR, but not LF)
       - local echo off (the programmer does echo itself)

5. Start "Impact" and load the FPGA with the design "flash-500.bit".
   (Use "flash-1600.bit" in case you have an S3E-1600 starter kit.)
   The platform flash ROM (xcf04s) and the CPLD (xc2c64a) should be
   in "bypass" mode. If the download succeeds, you should see the
   message "PicoBlaze NOR FLASH Programmer v1.00" on the computer
   which is connected via the serial line to the starter board, as
   well as a short menue of commands (E, B, P, W, R, I, H, S), and
   a prompt (">"). Try the commands 'h' (the menue should be sent
   again), 'i' (the device ID 89 18 should appear), and 's' (the
   status should be 80). You can close "Impact" now (and disconnect
   the USB cable, if you wish to do so).

6. Erase the flash ROM completely by pressing 'e'. This command must
   be confirmed with an upper case 'Y' and can run for a few minutes.
   The command sends the character '.' repeatedly to show its progress.

7. Program the ROM with the command 'p'. You will have to specify the
   name of the MCS file to your communication program somehow (with
   minicom, it's "CTRL-A Z Y <choose file> <okay>"). Your communication
   program should send the contents of the file as if it has been
   typed at the keyboard, without changing any character.

8. Verify what you have programmed with the command 'r', followed by
   exactly 6 hex digits which represent the starting address of 256
   bytes (that will be dumped to your screen).
