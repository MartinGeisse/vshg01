structure for the top-level CPU HDL file:

- signal declarations (control/data)
- submodules
- signal assignments (multiple assignments / processes, not one big process)

instruction decoder: generates signals solely from the current instruction
-> submodule

main state machine: generates signals mainly from the current state and helper signals,
should mainly uses helper signals from the instruction decoder and not directly from
the instruction.
-> main module
