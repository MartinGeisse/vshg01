
Build Instructions
------------------

Tools: Building Blocks-in-a-Row requires the ECO32 tool chain. It
  expects the Eco32 (0.20) Distribution to be placed next to the
  main blocks-in-a-row folder.

Software: Go into the "software" folder and run "make"
  (tested only on Cygwin). This produces "romimage.exo" which can
  be loaded into the flash ROM.

Hardware: Open blocks-in-a-row.npl in the "hardware" folder and synthesize. This
  produces "blocks-in-a-row.bit" which can be loaded into the FPGA.
